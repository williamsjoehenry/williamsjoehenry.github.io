                <h3>Bio</h3>

                After completing my undergraduate studies and beginning my career as a data engineer, I wanted to further increase my hard and soft data science skills with an M.S. I am excited to bring my unique interdisciplinary background, diverse professional experience in academic, governmental, and private healthcare data science and consulting, and first-class communication and collaboration skills to your organization.
                <br><br>
                As a contractor for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s Office of Research and Development, I used R, Python, and SQL to build and maintain data infrastructure, from automated web scraping to ETL pipelines to cloud storage solutions. I am grateful for the training I received in making my work reproducible and easily communicable as part of a federally regulated agency, and I am proud to say that my work was part of the cleanup efforts in East Palestine, Ohio last year.
                <br><br>
                However technically skilled an analyst may be, they are only as valuable as their communication skills, and through my interdisciplinary background I have been lucky enough to receive extensive training in scientific communication, rhetoric, and data journalism. I am equally happy writing documentation, presenting technical reports to internal collaborators, and discussing results with stakeholders.
                <br><br>
                As much as I enjoy getting my hands dirty in the data mines, the heart has room for many loves. In my free time, I enjoy birding, reading, and attempting to play the piano. I also sing bass in SONAM, a vocal ensemble dedicated to supporting local nonprofits through benefit concerts.
